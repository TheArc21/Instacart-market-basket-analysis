# Instacart-market-basket-analysis
The dataset, from Instacart, comprises 3M+ grocery orders by 200K+ users. It includes order specifics, product sequences, order timing, and aisle/department info.

The dataset for this project is obtained from Instacart, an electronic commerce grocery ordering and delivery organization. The dataset contains a sample of over 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users. The dataset contains details about the orders placed by various users, the sequence of products purchased in each order, the week and hour of day the order was placed, and a relative measure of time between orders. It also has information about the aisle and department for the sold products.

# Creating a Data Narrative for Instacart Grocery Orders Dataset

The project will follow the following steps:
  1. Acquiring Data
  2. Defining the Audience
  3. Data Analysis
  4. Curate my Views
  5. Organizing the Storyline with Storyboarding
  6. Creating a Story in Tableau
  7. Adding Rhetoric to Your Story
  8. Formatting the Story

# Acquiring Data 
The orders.csv file and the orders_products_train.csv file will be related to create a custom data source for every visualization. Tableau will automatically select join types based on the fields used in the visualization.
